# Problem Source: LeetCode

# Given an array of size n, find the majority element. 
# The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.

# You may assume that the array is non-empty and 
# the majority element always exist in the array.

# Throws memory error also will only work
# for ints from 0 to max

        nums_a[nums[i]] = nums_a[nums[i]]+1
    return nums_a[nums_a.index(max(nums_a))]


# This works. Not too efficient
